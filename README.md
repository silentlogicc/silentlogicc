## Hi there 🦊

I’m Arne, currently in my apprenticeship as an IT System Engineer (Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration).  
My main area in the apprenticeship is networking, but in my homelab I also enjoy exploring small scripting ideas and automation on the side.  
Documenting my learning steps helps me to see real progress over time, even if the steps are small.

### current project

I keep all my small steps, scripts and notes in my **homelab** repository.  
It is not perfect but this repo is about learning, not pretending.
